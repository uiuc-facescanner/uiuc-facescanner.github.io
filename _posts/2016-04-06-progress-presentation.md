Our group gave a presentation about our progress in lecture on Tuesday, April 5th, 2016.

## Presentation

Our presentation consisted of an overview of our project, and three short demonstrations:

1. Raspberry Pi / Servo / Camera script
2. Web server (GET/POST requests)
3. Facial detection

This was followed by a short QA session. We've made outstanding progress so far. Now we have to integrate our progress into one cohesive product. I look forward to our next meeting which will take place on Thursday, April 6th, 2016 at 4pm.
